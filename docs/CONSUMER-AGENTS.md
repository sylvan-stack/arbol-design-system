# Design-system instruction for application repositories

When adopting Arbol's design system, merge the following section into the application's root `AGENTS.md`. Preserve existing project instructions. If another agent tool uses a different instruction entrypoint, add a pointer there too. A README link alone does not ensure that an agent reads the maintenance rules.

```markdown
## Arbol design-system synchronization

The shared design reference is the private repository
https://github.com/sylvan-stack/arbol-design-system.

Every user-requested UI/UX design change must also update that repository as
part of the same task. Do not change only this application's design and leave
the shared reference stale. This includes styling, tokens, components, layouts,
navigation, responsive behavior, forms, dialogs, states and accessibility.
Backend-only changes with no observable UI/UX effect are exempt.

Before implementing a design change, locate the design-system checkout or use
`gh repo clone sylvan-stack/arbol-design-system`, then read its root AGENTS.md
and relevant design contracts. Follow its synchronization workflow: reuse or
generalize shared components, update executable stories and affected sections
and pages, document the resulting contract, and validate both implementations.
Keep production integrations in this application and fictional fixtures in the
design system. Preserve unrelated work in both repositories.

When delivering, identify the changes and validation in both repositories and
link their commits or PRs when available. Follow repository delivery rules and
the user's publishing instructions. If access or another dependency blocks
the shared update, explicitly report the unfinished work; do not claim the
design task is complete or remotely synchronized. Explicit user instructions
limiting scope or requesting a temporary experiment take precedence; disclose
any resulting divergence.
```

The full, maintained workflow lives in [the design-system AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Keep the application instruction as a pointer to that workflow rather than copying its implementation details, catalog counts or machine-specific checkout paths.
